NSY103 final project, C language socket chatroom application

 This program is written by Rami TOFEILY as a NSY103 Linux project fall-2020/2021
 It is a simple chat application which is consisted of a common chatroom
 where all connected users can talk in public
 similar to the good old IRC networks channels.

 it consists of two programs (executables), one for the room server, and one usre client

 it has been tested in real on three computers, two of them running Ubuntu 20.04 and one running LUbuntu

 in this project, basic communication between server and client was acheived by using sockets.
 supporting multiple clients, as well as handling sending and receiveing messages was acheived by using Multi-Threading 

 this project includes screenshots as well as a small video demo to show the run of the program.
